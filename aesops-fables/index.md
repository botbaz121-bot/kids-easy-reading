### The Fox and the Grapes

A hungry Fox saw a bunch of ripe grapes hanging high on a vine.  They looked juicy and delicious, but they were just out of reach.  He jumped again and again, each time missing by a little.  Tired and frustrated, he finally gave up and walked away, saying, “Those grapes are sour and not worth my trouble anyway.”

Even when something is desirable, people sometimes pretend to dislike it if they cannot have it.

### The Bundle of Sticks

A Father had several Sons who constantly argued and fought.  Hoping to teach them about unity, he asked each one to try and break a bundle of sticks bound together.  None could do it.  Then he untied the bundle and gave them the sticks one by one; they snapped easily in their hands.  “See,” he said, “if you work together and support each other, it’s hard for anyone to harm you.  Alone you are as weak as single twigs.”

Working together makes us stronger than we are alone.

### The Lion and the Mouse

A Lion was sleeping in the forest when a little Mouse accidentally ran across his nose.  The Lion woke in anger and trapped her under his paw.  She begged to be let go, promising to help him one day.  Amused, he released her.  Later, the Lion was caught in a hunter’s net and could not free himself.  The Mouse heard his roars, found him, and gnawed through the ropes, setting him free.  “You laughed at the idea that I could help you,” she said.  “Now you see that even the smallest creature can be a friend.”

A kind act is never wasted; help can come from unexpected places.
