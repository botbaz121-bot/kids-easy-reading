## The Frog Prince

In the olden time, when wishing was having, there lived a King, whose
daughters were all beautiful; but the youngest was so exceedingly
beautiful that the Sun himself, although he saw her very, very often,
was delighted every time she came out into the sunshine.

Near the castle of this King was a large and gloomy forest, where in the
midst stood an old lime‑tree, beneath whose branches splashed a little
fountain; so, whenever it was very hot, the King's youngest daughter ran
off into this wood, and sat down by the side of the fountain; and, when
she felt dull, would often divert herself by throwing a golden ball up
into the air and catching it again.  And this was her favorite amusement.

Now, one day it happened that this golden ball, when the King's daughter
threw it into the air, did not fall down into her hand, but on to the
grass; and then it rolled right into the fountain.  The King's daughter
followed the ball with her eyes, but it disappeared beneath the water,
which was so deep that she could not see to the bottom.  Then she began
to lament, and to cry more loudly and more loudly; and, as she cried, a
voice called out, "Why weepest thou, O King's daughter?  thy tears would
melt even a stone to pity."  She looked around to the spot whence the
voice came, and saw a frog stretching his thick, ugly head out of the
water.  "Ah! you old water‑paddler," said she, "was it you that spoke?  I
am weeping for my golden ball which bounced away from me into the
water."

"Be quiet, and do not cry," replied the Frog; "I can give thee good
assistance.  But what wilt thou give me if I succeed in fetching thy
plaything up again?"

"What would you like, dear Frog?" said she.  "My dresses, my pearls and
jewels, or the golden crown which I wear?"

The Frog replied, "Dresses, or jewels, or golden crowns, are not for me;
but if thou wilt love me, and let me be thy companion and playmate, and
sit at thy table, and eat from thy little golden plate, and drink out of
thy cup, and sleep in thy little bed,—if thou wilt promise me all these
things, then I will dive down and fetch up thy golden ball."

"Oh, I will promise you all," said she, "if you will only get me my
golden ball."  But she thought to herself, "What is the silly Frog
chattering about?  Let him stay in the water with his equals; he cannot
enter into society."  Then the Frog, as soon as he had received her
promise, drew his head under the water and dived down.  Presently he swam
up again with the golden ball in his mouth, and threw it on to the
grass.  The King's daughter was full of joy when she again saw her
beautiful plaything; and, taking it up, she ran off immediately.  "Stop!
stop!" cried the Frog; "take me with thee.  I cannot run as thou canst."

But this croaking was of no avail; although it was loud enough, the
King's daughter did not hear it, but, hastening home, soon forgot the
poor Frog, who was obliged to leap back into the fountain.

The next day, when the King's daughter was sitting at table with her
father and all his courtiers, and was eating from her own little golden
plate, something was heard coming up the marble stairs, splish‑splash,
splish‑splash; and when it arrived at the top, it knocked at the door,
and a voice said—

> "Open the door, thou youngest daughter of the King!"

So she arose and went to see who it was that called to her; but when she
opened the door and caught sight of the Frog, she shut it again very
quickly and with great passion, and sat down at the table, looking
exceedingly pale.

But the King perceived that her heart was beating violently, and asked
her whether it were a giant who had come to fetch her away who stood at
the door.  "Oh, no!" answered she; "it is no giant, but an ugly Frog."

"What does the Frog want with you?" said the King.

"Oh, dear father, yesterday when I was playing by the fountain, my
golden ball fell into the water, and this Frog fetched it up again
because I cried so much: but first, I must tell you, he pressed me so
much, that I promised him he should be my companion.  I never thought
that he could come out of the water, but somehow he has managed to jump
out, and now he wants to come in here."

At that moment there was another knock, and a voice said—

> "King's daughter, youngest,
>   Open the door.
>   Hast thou forgotten
>   Thy promises made
>   At the fountain so clear
>   'Neath the lime‑tree's shade?
>   King's daughter, youngest,
>   Open the door."

Then the King said, "What you have promised, that you must perform; go
and let him in."  So the King's daughter went and opened the door, and
the Frog hopped in after her right up to her chair: and as soon as she
was seated, he said, "Lift me up;" but she hesitated so long that the
King had to order her to obey.  And as soon as the Frog sat on the chair
he jumped on to the table and said, "Now push thy plate near me, that we
may eat together."  And she did so, but as every one noticed, very
unwillingly.  The Frog seemed to relish his dinner very much, but every
bit that the King's daughter ate nearly choked her, till at last the
Frog said, "I have satisfied my hunger, and feel very tired; wilt thou
carry me upstairs now into thy chamber, and make thy bed ready that we
may sleep together?"  At this speech the King's daughter began to cry,
for she was afraid of the cold Frog, and dared not touch him; and
besides, he actually wanted to sleep in her own beautiful, clean bed!

But her tears only made the King very angry, and he said, "He who helped
you in the time of your trouble must not now be despised!"  So she took
the Frog up with two fingers, and put him into a corner of her chamber.
But as she lay in her bed, he crept up to it, and said, "I am so very
tired that I shall sleep well; do take me up, or I will tell thy
father."  This speech put the King's daughter into a terrible passion,
and catching the Frog up, she threw him with all her strength against
the wall, saying "Now will you be quiet, you ugly Frog!"

But as he fell he was changed from a Frog into a handsome Prince with
beautiful eyes, who after a little while became her dear companion and
betrothed.  One morning, Henry, trusted servant of the Prince, came for
them with a carriage.  When his master was changed into a frog, trusty
Henry had grieved so much that he had bound three iron bands around his
heart, for fear it should break with grief and sorrow.  The faithful
Henry helped in the bride and bridegroom, and placed himself in the seat
behind, full of joy at his master's release.  They had not proceeded far
when the Prince heard a crack as if something had broken behind the
carriage; so he put his head out of the window and asked trusty Henry
what was broken, and faithful Henry answered, "It was not the carriage,
my master, but an iron band which I bound around my heart when it was in
such grief because you were changed into a frog."

Twice afterwards on the journey there was the same noise, and each time
the Prince thought that it was some part of the carriage that had given
way; but it was only the breaking of the bands which bound the heart of
the trusty Henry, and who was thenceforward free and happy.

## Little Red‑Cap

Many years ago there lived a dear little girl who was beloved by every
one who knew her; but her grand‑mother was so very fond of her that she
never felt she could think and do enough to please this dear
grand‑daughter, and she presented the little girl with a red silk cap,
which suited her so well, that she would never wear anything else, and
so was called Little Red‑Cap.

One day Red‑Cap's mother said to her, "Come, Red‑Cap, here is a nice
piece of meat, and a bottle of wine: take these to your grandmother; she
is weak and ailing, and they will do her good.  Be there before she gets
up; go quietly and carefully."

The grandmother lived far away in the wood, a long walk from the
village, and as Little Red‑Cap came among the trees she met a Wolf; but
she did not know what a wicked animal it was, and so she was not at all
frightened.  "Good morning, Little Red‑Cap," he said.

"Thank you, Mr. Wolf," said she.

"Where are you going so early, Little Red‑Cap?"

"To my grandmother's," she answered.

"And what are you carrying in that basket?"

"Some wine and meat," she replied.  "We baked the meat yesterday, so
that grandmother, who is very weak, might have a nice strengthening
meal."

"And where does your grandmother live?" asked the Wolf.

"Oh, quite twenty minutes’ walk further in the forest.  The cottage stands
under three great oak trees; and close by are some nut bushes, by which
you will at once know it."

The Wolf was thinking to himself, "She is a nice tender thing, and will
taste better than the old woman; I must act cleverly, that I may make a
meal of both."

Presently he came up again to Little Red‑Cap, and said, "Just look at
the beautiful flowers which grow around you; why do you not look about
you?  I believe you don't hear how sweetly the birds are singing.  You
walk as if you were going to school; see how cheerful everything is
about you in the forest."

And Little Red‑Cap opened her eyes; and when she saw how the sunbeams
glanced and danced through the trees, and what bright flowers were
blooming in her path, she thought, "If I take my grandmother a fresh
nosegay, she will be very much pleased; and it is so very early that I
can, even then, get there in good time;" and running into the forest,
she looked about for flowers.  But when she had once begun she did not
know how to leave off, and kept going deeper and deeper amongst the
trees looking for some still more beautiful flower.  The Wolf, however,
ran straight to the house of the old grandmother, and knocked at the
door.

"Who's there?" asked the old lady.

"Only Little Red‑Cap, bringing you some meat and wine; please open the
door," answered the Wolf.  "Lift up the latch," cried the grandmother; "I
am much too ill to get up myself."

So the Wolf lifted the latch, and the door flew open; and without a
word, he jumped on to the bed, and gobbled up the poor old lady.  Then he
put on her clothes, and tied her night‑cap over his head; got into the
bed, and drew the blankets over him.  All this time Red‑Cap was
gathering flowers; and when she had picked as many as she could carry,
she thought of her grandmother, and hurried to the cottage.  She wondered
greatly to find the door open; and when she got into the room, she began
to feel very ill, and exclaimed, "How sad I feel!  I wish I had not come
to‑day."  Then she said, "Good morning," but received no reply; so she
went up to the bed, and drew back the curtains, and there lay her
grandmother, as she imagined, with the cap drawn half over her eyes, and
looking very fierce.

"Oh, grandmother, what great ears you have!" she said.

"All the better to hear you with," was the reply.

"And what great eyes you have!"

"All the better to see you with."

"And what great hands you have!"

"All the better to touch you with."

"But, grandmother, what very great teeth you have!"

"All the better to eat you with;" and hardly were the words spoken when
the Wolf made a jump out of bed, and swallowed up poor Little Red‑Cap
also.

As soon as the Wolf had thus satisfied his hunger, he laid himself down
again on the bed, and went to sleep and snored very loudly.  A huntsman
passing by overheard him, and said, "How loudly that old woman snores!  I
must see if anything is the matter."

So he went into the cottage; and when he came to the bed, he saw the
Wolf sleeping in it.  "What!  are you here, you old rascal?  I have been
looking for you," exclaimed he; and taking up his gun, he shot the old
Wolf through the head.

But it is also said that the story ends in a different manner; for that
one day, when Red‑Cap was taking some presents to her grandmother, a
Wolf met her, and wanted to mislead her; but she went straight on, and
told her grandmother that she had met a Wolf, who said good day, and who
looked so hungrily out of his great eyes, as if he would have eaten her
up had she not been on the high‑road.

So her grandmother said, "We will shut the door, and then he cannot get
in."  Soon after, up came the Wolf, who tapped, and exclaimed, "I am
Little Red‑Cap, grandmother; I have some roast meat for you."  But they
kept quite quiet, and did not open the door; so the Wolf, after looking
several times round the house, at last jumped on the roof, thinking to
wait till Red‑Cap went home in the evening, and then to creep after her
and eat her in the darkness.  The old woman, however, saw what the
villain intended.  There stood before the door a large stone trough, and
she said to Little Red‑Cap, "Take this bucket, dear: yesterday I boiled
some meat in this water, now pour it into the stone trough."  Then the
Wolf sniffed the smell of the meat, and his mouth watered, and he wished
very much to taste.  At last he stretched his neck too far over, so that
he lost his balance, and fell down from the roof, right into the great
trough below, and there he was drowned.

## Rapunzel

![Rapunzel illustration](images/rapunzel.jpg)

There were once a man and a woman who had long in in vain wished for a
child.  At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.
These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a
splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful
flowers and herbs.  It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no
one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had
great power and was dreaded by all the world.  One day the woman was
standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a
bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it
looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest
desire to eat some.  This desire increased every day, and as she knew
that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and looked pale
and miserable.  Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, "What ails you,
dear wife?"  "Ah," she replied, "if I can't get some of the rampion which
is in the garden behind our house, to eat, I shall die."  The man, who
loved her, thought, "Sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of
the rampion yourself, let it cost you what it will."  In the twilight of
evening, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the
enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his
wife.  She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it with much
relish.  She, however, liked it so much, so very much, that the next day
she longed for it three times as much as before.  If he was to have any
rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden.  In the gloom
of evening, therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had
clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the
enchantress standing before him.  "How can you dare," said she with angry
look, "to descend into my garden and steal my rampion like a thief?  You
shall suffer for it!"  "Ah," answered he, "let mercy take the place of
justice.  I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity.  My wife saw
your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she
would have died if she had not got some to eat."  Then the enchantress
allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, "If the case be as
you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you
will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your
wife will bring into the world; it shall be well treated, and I will
care for it like a mother."  The man in his terror consented to
everything, and when the little one came to them, the enchantress
appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away
with her.

Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child beneath the sun.  When she
was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay
in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a
little window.  When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself
beneath this, and cried,

> "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
> Let down your hair to me."

Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she
heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,
wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair
fell twenty yards down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.

After a year or two, it came to pass that the King's son rode through
the forest and went by the tower.  Then he heard a song, which was so
charming that he stood still and listened.  This was Rapunzel, who in her
solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound.  The King's
son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but
none was to be found.  He rode home, but the singing had so deeply
touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and
listened to it.  Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw
that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried,

> "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
> Let down your hair."

Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress
climbed up to her.  "If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I will
for once try my fortune," said he, and the next day, when it began to
grow dark, he went to the tower and cried.

> "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
> Let down your hair."

Immediately the hair fell down, and the King's son climbed up.

At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man such as her eyes
had never yet beheld came to her; but the King's son began to talk to
her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred
that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.
Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him
for a husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought,
"He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does;" and she said yes, and
laid her hand in his.  She said, "I will willingly go away with you, but
I do not know how to get down.  Bring with you a skein of silk every time
that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready
I will descend, and you will take me on your horse."  They agreed that
until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman
came by day.  The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once
Rapunzel said to her, "Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are
so much heavier for me to draw up than the young King's son—he is with
me in a moment."  "Ah!  you wicked child," cried the enchantress, "what do
I hear you say!  I thought I had separated you from all the world, and
yet you have deceived me!"  In her anger she clutched Rapunzel's
beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair
of scissors with the right, and snip, snip, they were cut off, and the
lovely braids lay on the ground.  And she was so pitiless that she took
poor Rapunzel into a desert, where she had to live in great grief and
misery.

On the same day, however, that she cast out Rapunzel, the enchantress in
the evening fastened the braids of hair which she had cut off to the
hook of the window, and when the King's son came and cried,

> "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
> Let down your hair,"

she let the hair down.  The King's son ascended, but he did not find his
dearest Rapunzel above, but the enchantress, who gazed at him with
wicked and venomous looks.  "Aha!" she cried mockingly.  "You would fetch
your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;
the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well.  Rapunzel is
lost to you; you will never see her more."  The King's son was beside
himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower.  He
escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his
eyes.  Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but
roots and berries, and did nothing but lament and weep over the loss of
his dearest wife.  Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and
at length came to the desert where Rapunzel lived in wretchedness.  He
heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it,
and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept.
Two of her tears wetted his eyes, and they grew clear again, and he
could see with them as before.  He led her to his kingdom, where he was
joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and
contented.
